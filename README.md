# Nepal Population by District ‚Äî 2021 Census (SQL Project)

This project explores district-level population data from Nepal's 2021 Census using SQLite. The goal was to extract clean, structured insights on population distribution, gender breakdown, and household sizes ‚Äî perfect for beginner SQL portfolio work and data storytelling.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

This dataset includes:

- `district` ‚Äî Name of each administrative district in Nepal
- `population` ‚Äî Total population (sum of male + female)
- `male` ‚Äî Total male population
- `female` ‚Äî Total female population
- `households` ‚Äî Number of households in the district

## üìä SQL Query Used

CREATE VIEW "by_district" AS
SELECT
    district,
    SUM(families) AS families,
    SUM(households) AS households,
    SUM(population) AS population,
    SUM(male) AS male,
    SUM(female) AS female
FROM census
GROUP BY district;


CREATE VIEW "most_populated" AS
SELECT
    district,
    SUM(families) AS families,
    SUM(households) AS households,
    SUM(population) AS population,
    SUM(male) AS male,
    SUM(female) AS female
FROM census
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY population DESC;;

CREATE VIEW rural AS
SELECT *
FROM census
WHERE LOWER (district) LIKE '%rural%'
    OR LOWER (locality) LIKE '%rural%';

CREATE VIEW "total_population" AS
SELECT
    SUM(families) AS families,
    SUM(households) AS households,
    SUM(population) AS population,
    SUM(male) AS male,
    SUM(female) AS female
FROM census;



üîé Additional Analysis (Ideas)
Gender Ratio by District
ROUND(male * 1.0 / female, 2) to identify imbalance hotspots

Average Household Size
ROUND(population * 1.0 / households, 2) to assess density and resource demand

üìÅ Files
0.sql ‚Äì SQL script used to query the dataset

nepal_population_by_district.csv ‚Äì Cleaned dataset output

(Optional: Tableau / Power BI dashboards to follow)

üìå Insights
Kathmandu is the most populous district, with over 2 million residents.

Rural districts like Manang and Mustang have very low population densities.

Gender ratios and household sizes vary significantly between districts, providing rich ground for further data exploration.
